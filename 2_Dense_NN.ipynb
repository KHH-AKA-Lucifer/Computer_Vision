    "A basic **neural network** in PyTorch consists of a number of **layers**. The simplest network would include just one fully-connected layer, which is called **Linear** layer, with 784 inputs (one input for each pixel of the input image) and 10 outputs (one output for each class).\n",

    "<img alt=\"A graph showing how an image is broken into layers based on the pixels.\" src=\"images/3-train-dense-neural-networks-1.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed above, the dimension of our digit images is $1\\times28\\times28$, i.e. each image contains $28\\times28=784$ different pixels. Because linear layer expects its input as one-dimensional vector, we need to insert another layer into the network, called **Flatten**, to change input tensor shape from $1\\times28\\times28$ to $784$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After `Flatten`, there is a main linear layer (called `Dense` in PyTorch terminology) that converts 784 inputs to 10 outputs - one per class. We want $n$-th output of the network to return the probability of the input digit being equal to $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the output of a fully-connected layer is not normalized to be between 0 and 1, it cannot be thought of as probability. Moreover, if want outputs to be probabilities of different digits, they all need to add up to 1. To turn output vectors into probability vector, a function called **Softmax** is often used as the last activation function in a classification neural network. For example, $\\mathrm{softmax}([-1,1,2]) = [0.035,0.25,0.705]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In PyTorch, we often prefer to use **LogSoftmax** function, which will also compute logarithms of output probabilities. To turn the output vector into the actual probabilities, we need to take **torch.exp** of the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the architecture of our network can be represented by the following sequence of layers:\n",
